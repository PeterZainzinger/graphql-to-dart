This is an example project for using `graphql-to-dart`. Note that this is still very rough around the edges. You'll need most of what's in the `pubspec.yaml`, `build.yaml`, and `codegen.yml`.

The main integration point with the `graphql-to-dart` generated code is in `lib/episode.dart`.
To run this example, run `yarn test-server` and `flutter run` in different terminals.

This example uses `graphql_flutter` as well as some wrapper components, which I'll hopefully be able to integrate there at some point as well.
